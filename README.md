# Tinder clone

This project is a full stack application built with React.js, css-modules, react-tinder-card, MongoDB, react-cookies.
The application has:
  - :door: an authentication form, 
  - :white_check_mark: a registration form, 
  - :love_letter: a chat,
  - :flower_playing_cards: swipable cards with users.
The data is stored in the mongoDB server in two collections: users and messages.
User authentication occurs with the help of cookies.
